# Predictive-Analytics-Project
In this project, I delved into the famous 'Titanic' dataset using Python to explore survival patterns among passengers. I started by cleaning the data, addressing missing values,and converting categorical data into numerical formats. 
For the analysis, I used three different predictive techniques: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), leveraging the scikit-learn library.
Each model was carefully evaluated for its accuracy and performance. The Random Forest model stood out, effectively handling the complexities of the dataset and providing the best results. Logistic Regression also performed well, offering clear and interpretable insights.
However, the SVM model struggled with the dataset's intricacies. Overall, this project provided meaningful insights into the factors that influenced survival rates on the Titanic, showcasing the power of predictive analytics.
